MIST-Explorer
===========================

Our application is a powerful and intuitive tool designed for researchers and scientists in the field of single-cell proteomics. It allows users to load, visualize, and analyze protein distribution at the single-cell level. By providing a user-friendly interface, the app enables seamless exploration of protein expression data, helping to uncover insights into cellular functions, interactions, and heterogeneity.

Key Features
-------
- **Easy Viewer**: Easily import protein expression data of any size, and interactively explore detailed protein distributions within specific regions of interest at both single-cell and group levels.
- **Alignment & Registration**: Align and register protein expression data across multiple layers/cycles within a few pixels of accuracy by using our registration pipeline.
- **Microbead Decoding**:  Decode aligned microbeads to determine protein readout from tissue sample in a computationally efficient way.
- **Interactive Visualization**: View protein distribution and expression levels across individual cells with the view tab.
- **Customizable Graphs**: Create customizable graphs to visualize protein expression trends over time, in different experimental conditions, or across cell types. (TBD, somewhat)
- **Clustering & Classification**: Utilize clustering algorithms to group cells based on protein expression profiles for more targeted analysis. (TDB)

Advanced Analytics
-------
- **Statistical Analysis**: Perform basic statistical operations on protein expression data to detect significant differences.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Integrate machine learning models for advanced pattern recognition and prediction of protein interactions.

Requirements
-------
- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS tested 
- **Minimum Hardware**: 8 GB RAM, 2 GHz Processor
- **Dependencies**: Python (with libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib), JavaScript (for web-based interfaces), and cloud-based storage options (if applicable).
